The Little Book of the Icelanders in the Old Days
We were somewhere in the remote Westfjords, a large peninsula in Icelands north-west corner, when our campervan first stalled. It was late September, the end of the tourist season in a part of Iceland that sees about 6% the countrys annual tourist numbers, and the roads were all but empty.<br><br>The van stalled twice more as my husband and I made the roughly 200km drive from Latrabjarg, a windswept bird cliff perched on the far western edge of Iceland, back to our base in Isafjordur, the Westfjords largest town (pop: 2,600). Once we finally got back to our apartment, we called the campervan rental company and told them the issue. Unfortunately, the town mechanic wouldnt be available before we were due to make the drive back to Reykjavik.<br><br>A quick Google search informed me that petta reddast (pronounced thet-ta red-ust) doesnt mean "sorry, I am not paid enough to care about your troubles", or "try not to get stranded in the middle of nowhere". It means "it will all work out in the end" and if Iceland had an official slogan, this would be it. The phrase near-perfectly sums up the way Icelanders seem to approach life: with a laid-back, easy-going attitude and a great sense of humour.<br><br>"It is just one of those ubiquitous phrases that is around you all the time, a life philosophy wafting through the air," said Alda Sigmundsdottir, author of several books about Iceland history and culture. "It is generally used in a fairly flippant, upbeat manner. It can also be used to offer comfort, especially if the person doing the comforting doesnt quite know what to say. It is sort of a catch-all phrase that way."<br><br>While Iceland today is an ultra-modern place where wi-fi is abundant, credit cards are accepted everywhere, and the majority of the country is powered by geothermal energy, it was only about 90 years ago that 50% of the population lived in turf houses (traditional homes with walls and roofs made of earth and grass) so these hardships arent such a distant memory. Just 45 years ago, the Eldfell volcano exploded on the small island of Heimaey, spewing millions of tons of ash, engulfing 400 buildings and forcing the evacuation of all 5,000 people who lived there. And just 23 years ago, a massive avalanche decimated the town of Flateyri in the Westfjords, burying more than a dozen homes and killing 20 of the town 300 residents.

What do slugs hate? Home remedies put to the test
Researchers at the Royal Horticultural Society are investigating whether the likes of egg shells and copper have any effect in keeping slugs away.<br><br>The RHS is starting scientific trials of five traditional remedies to see if they are based on science or myth.<br><br>Dr Hayley Jones says the results, available in the autumn, will help them advise gardeners with real confidence.<br><br>"It will really start to tell us how well some of these barriers work," she said. "Is it worth spending your time and money on them?"<br><br>Until now there has been no formal study of the benefits of copper tape, sharp horticultural grit, pine bark mulch, wool pellets and egg shells, compared with doing nothing, she said.<br><br>"With slugs and snails regularly topping the list of gardener complaints we want to know if home remedies have a role to play or are nothing more than a plants mans placebo" said Dr Jones, an RHS entomologist.<br><br>The methods will be tested at the RHS research facility at Wisley Gardens, on lettuce plants grown in pots and raised beds.<br><br>The plants will be examined weekly for signs of damage and, at the end of the experiment, all the lettuces will be harvested and weighed.<br><br>Meanwhile, a garden at this year RHS Chatworth Flower Show, will highlight the importance of plant health. Dr Jones said many people dont realise that slugs can be an important part of the ecosystem in the garden.<br><br>They are "super interesting", and often overlooked, she added.

Lorem Ipsum
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br><br>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which dont look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isnt anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.<br><br>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.', 'Bart Simpson', '2011-06-25 17:23:44');
